<h2></h2>

Hi there and welcome to  Monsterzoo. This project is for a school assignment. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate that I could build a front-end JavaScript application, without the use of large frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular. Other than a case describing the funciton of the application, I had to start from scratchâ€”building up the structure of the project.

#### ðŸ“„ Case

The company Monsters 'n Madness had given me an assignmentâ€”to create an interface using which different monsters can be configured and placed within a region of their zoo. The monsters have different attributes that can be configured such as: skin, arms, legs, etc. The company had a (very) limited amount of time.

## ðŸ‘€ Design
