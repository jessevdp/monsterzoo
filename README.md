# Monster Zoo

School project. The point of this assignment was to show that I could build a front-end application without the use of modern frameworks like React/Angular/Vue. I took it upon myself toâ€”within a reasonable amount of timeâ€”come up with my own component like rendering model. While a slightly crappy design would have been fine for this assignment, I decided to spend a bit of time polishing up the interface.

The application features:
* A configurator with all sorts of validation rules based on the type of monster that is being created
* A drag and drop interface
* A weather integration for 3 different regions
* An animated background
